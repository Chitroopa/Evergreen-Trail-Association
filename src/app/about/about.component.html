      Although there are many important principles that guide our work, we emphasize the following values as core to our efforts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Passion and Leadership of People-</b> The great work of the trail is a result of past visionaries who took a dream and made it happen. Passion for the trail experience continues to spread, inspiring the remarkable contributions from our volunteer leaders, professional staff, partners, and the rest of the PCT community</li>
      <li><b>Collaboration-</b> We work in positive and cooperative partnerships to make the most of resources available to the organization. We are committed to mutual trust and respect with our partners, and we strive to resolve differences when they may emerge with respect and civility.</li>
      <li><b>Integrity â€“</b>We understand that our success and reputation depends on our integrity as an organization, and therefore will endeavor to use consistent, reliable decision-making to guide our efforts. We apply common sense and good judgment to our work, and recognize our essential responsibility to use contributions and resources to best support the needs of the trail.</li>
